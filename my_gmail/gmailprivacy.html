        Returns and refunds are a part of doing business online. <br>

Customers might be unsatisfied with their order for a number of reasons—it arrived damaged, they ordered the wrong size, or it simply didn’t meet their expectations. Alternatively, many buyers will purchase multiple versions of the same item—say, the same pair of jeans in various sizes—to try out at home. This practice is known as bracketing, and has become a more common practice since the pandemic. <br>
Without a proper system for handling returns, including a clear return policy, these requests can eat up a lot of time, energy, and money, with hours spent on customer service emails and spikes in shipping expenses for replacement products, especially after the holidays. <br>

The good news is that it’s never too late to address the problem. With a great return policy and the right system in place, returns can turn from a dreaded task into an opportunity that generates new profits and increases customer loyalty. <br>

Before we dive into how to write a return policy for your store and implement a system to handle requests, let’s talk about why it’s so important to get returns right. <br>
